The purpose of comments in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is to provide a way for web developers to include explanatory or informational text within the code that is not visible to the end users of a web page. Comments are ignored by web browsers and are only meant for developers and anyone who may need to read or work with the HTML code. They serve several important functions:

1. **Documentation**: Comments can be used to document the purpose and structure of various parts of your HTML document. This can be especially helpful for larger and more complex web pages where multiple developers may collaborate, or if you need to revisit and edit your code at a later date.

2. **Debugging**: Comments can be used to temporarily remove or "comment out" sections of code for debugging purposes. This can help you isolate issues and test different parts of your webpage without deleting code permanently.

3. **Clarification**: Comments can clarify the purpose of specific elements, attributes, or sections of your HTML, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand the code.

example of how to use comments in an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

    <!-- This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following paragraph -->
    <p>
      This is a paragraph of text. It's part of the main content of the page.
    </p>

    <!-- Here's another comment -->
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <!-- Commenting out this list item for debugging purposes
        <li>Item 3</li>
        -->
      <li>Item 4</li>
    </ul>

    <!--
    This is a multiline comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
    Comments are not displayed in the web browser.
    -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- Comments are enclosed within `<!--` and `-->` delimiters.
- You can see comments explaining the purpose of the `<p>` element and how one list item is commented out within the `<ul>` element.
- There's also a multiline comment at the end, which can be used to add more extensive explanations.
